can you give me a sample jhipster JDL model, for an application handling these entities: Ride (id, rideDateTime, rideCityFrom, rideCityTo, rideType, rideUser, rideComments), City (id, cityName), Users (id, userName, userEmail, userRole, userPhone, userStatus). rideType can be OFFER or REQUEST. userStatus can be ACTIVE or SUSPENDED. userRole can be ADMIN or USER
